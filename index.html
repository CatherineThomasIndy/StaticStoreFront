        <h3>Hyrule News</h3>
        <p>
            His Majesty The King announced today that Hyrule's alliance with 
            the Gerudo Valley had been solidified when Lord Ganondorf pledged 
            his allegiance to His Majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until this point, little has been known about Gerudo Valley. Any 
            man who has entered before has been imprisoned by the Gerudo. 
            Rumours say that Gerudo Town is full of beautiful (and powerful) 
            women. In fact, legends say that a man is only born once every 
            hundred years, and that he is destined to be their king as 
            Ganondorf is now.
        </p>

            In other news, travelers have reported an increase in obstacles on 
            the road to Kakariko village--more specifically, monsters. Anyone 
            who is planning to leave Hyrule Castle Town is advised to be wary 
            of Peahats during the day. A guard posted by the drawbridge had 
            this to say: "It's imperative that travelers reach a safe destination 
            before nightfall. Stalchilds roam Hyrule field at night." Citizens 
            are warned that the drawbridge closes every night at dusk before the 
            stalchilds can enter the town.
